# **Automated PICO Element Detection for Biomedical Literature**

## **Introduction**
The **evidence-based medicine (EBM)** approach relies on integrating findings from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) into clinical decision-making. This project aims to **automate PICO element detection** in medical literature using deep learning models, improving literature retrieval and analysis for clinical research.

The **PICO framework** breaks down clinical questions into four key components:
- **P**articipants/Problem
- **I**ntervention
- **C**omparison
- **O**utcome

Since many biomedical abstracts lack clear PICO labeling, this project focuses on automating their classification using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.

## **Project Workflow**
### **1. Dataset Collection & Preprocessing**
- Used **PubMed PICO Element Detection Dataset** from randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
- Applied **text cleaning, tokenization, and embedding generation**.
- Explored custom **Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText embeddings**.

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualized PICO element distribution.
- Analyzed sentence lengths, word frequency, and PICO co-occurrence patterns.

### **3. Feature Engineering**
- Mapped **PICO elements** to numerical classes.
- Converted text data into word embeddings using **Word2Vec**.
- Applied **padding** and **one-hot encoding** for model input structuring.

### **4. Model Training & Evaluation**
- **Baseline Model:** Logistic Regression with TF-IDF (**Accuracy: 27.3%**).
- **Deep Learning Models:**
  - **Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN)** (**Accuracy: 29.1%**)
  - **BiLSTM with Attention** (**Accuracy: 77.74%**)
  - **BERT** (**Accuracy: 84.2%**)
  - **DistilBERT (Knowledge Distillation)** (**Accuracy: 84.43%**) â†’ Best model!

### **5. Final Model Deployment**
- **DistilBERT was selected** for its high accuracy and computational efficiency.
- Model trained for **PICO element classification** in medical abstracts.
